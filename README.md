# Poker Pre-Flop CLI Helper for 6-Max Texas Holdem
This is a command line application that allows you to insert your specific hand and then based on the actions of the other players, guides you on what to do next. Thanks to BlackRain79 Poker for ranges.

# Instructions:
<ol>
  <li>Save the pre-flop-poker-cli.py file to your desired location. </li>
  <li>Open up the terminal and navigate to the folder where the file was saved.</li>
  <li>Run the code `python pre-flop-poker-cli.py`</li>
  <li>Then follow the instructions on the screen as it guides you on how to play your dealt hand based on the actions of the other players.</li>
</ol>

# Notes:
<ul>
  <li>Hole cards must be entered as suited or off-suit hands. For example, if you have Ace hearts and Ten hearts, you'd type `ATs` ("s" stands for suited) or if you have Ace spades Ten clubs, you'd type `ATo` ("o" stands for offsuit).</li>
  <li>To reset the app, you can simply press `ctrl + c`, the hit the up arrow which should display the last command used which was `python pre-flop-poker-cli.py` and hit `enter` to run it again/</li>

</ul>
